Electrical_Equipment_Health_Audit_Report: 
The Electrical Equipment Health Audit was conducted at YERA Glasses to comprehensively evaluate the condition,
performance, and remaining service life of key electrical assets across the facility. This initiative focused
on enhancing system reliability, safety, and efficiency through early detection of potential failure points
and degradation trends. The audit covered three main components: switchgear systems, power transformers, and motor
control center (MCC) panels. A structured methodology was employed, including visual inspections,
mechanical assessments, diagnostic testing, and thermal imaging. Specific tests included insulation
resistance testing, oil quality analysis, partial discharge detection, and infrared thermography.[Learn more](Electrical_Equipment_Health_Audit_Report.pdf)
