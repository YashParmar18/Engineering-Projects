Electrical_Equipment_Health_Audit_Report: 

The Electrical Equipment Health Audit was conducted at YERA Glasses to comprehensively evaluate the condition, performance, and remaining service life of key electrical assets across the facility. This initiative focused on enhancing system reliability, safety, and efficiency through early detection of potential failure points and degradation trends. The audit covered three main components: switchgear systems, power transformers, and motor control center (MCC) panels. A structured methodology was employed, including visual inspections, mechanical assessments, diagnostic testing, and thermal imaging. Specific tests included insulation resistance testing, oil quality analysis, partial discharge detection, and infrared thermography.[Learn more](Electrical_Equipment_Health_Audit_Report.pdf)

Energy_Efficiency_Project_Report

This project focused on enhancing energy efficiency within a manufacturing facility by modernizing its motor systems and integrating Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). Led by the Maintenance Electrical Engineerin team, the initiative was a strategic response to high electricity costs and inefficient legacy equipment identified during an internal energy audit.Beyond cost reduction, the project contributed to improved process control, equipment longevity, and a lower carbon footprint. It also established a framework for ongoing energy optimization and digital monitoring.[Learn more](Energy_Efficiency_Project_Report.pdf)

PLC_Automation_Project_Report

This report presents a comprehensive overview of the PLC-based automation system developed for a glass product manufacturing line. The primary objective of this system is to ensure efficient, safe, and reliable operation of the production machine table used for handling hot raw glass. The system has been designed using programmable logic controllers (PLCs), integrating sensors, timers, motors, alarms, and actuators to automate the key phases of the production process.[Learn more](PLC_Automation_Project_Report.pdf)
